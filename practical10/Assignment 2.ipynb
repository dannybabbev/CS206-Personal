    "1\\. From your reading you know that the naive Bayes classifier works by calculating the conditional probabilities of each feature, $e_i$, occuring with each class $c$ and treating them independently. This results in the probability of a certain class occuring given a set of features, or a piece of evidence, $E$, as\n",

Recall the use of Laplace smoothing introduced toward the end of Chapter 3 in the section Probability Estimation.

The result of Laplace smoothing will slightly change the conditional probabilities,\n",
